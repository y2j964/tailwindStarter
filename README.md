## General Info
This is a simple frontend boilerplate that provides tailwindcss config. It additionally uses live-server to set up a live-server, but assumes you have live-server installed globally (if you don't, go do that). There is no css minification, as this is not intended to be used in real production environments. You might use this if you wanted a CodePen-esque setup but want to work in a code editor.

## Features
* TailwindCSS
* PostCSS

## Setup
Simply clone this repo, and run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

### Scripts
Here is our sole script:

#### `npm run css`
Sets up a file watch that generates css from tailwind files.
